Sage and Linear Algebra
-----------------------

This is a collection of classroom-tested worksheets to accompany Beezer's [First Course in Linear Algebra](http://linear.pugetsound.edu/).  The `worksheets` directory is keyed to the acronyms of seventeen sections of the book (of a possible thirty-seven sections).  There are two purposes:
  * Understand linear algebra better through computational experiments.
  * Learn Sage syntax, and Sage commands, for exact linear algebra.

These are designed to be presented in class, and the overview includes time estimates when used that way.  The exercises are designed for an instructor to walk through, and talk through, while presenting the worksheet.  A motivated student, perhaps studying independently, could attempt the exercises.  There are no "solutions," but there is some guidance about commands to employ.

For each section covered there is
  * PDF: which does not show the empty Sage cells present elsewhere
  * HTML: a single webpage, with active Sage cells, and empty cells for the exercises.  These require no more set-up than an internet-connected browser, but there is no facility for saving your work.
  * Jupyter Notebooks: these can be viewed in a variety of ways, but require a Sage kernel.  [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) is a natural choice, while a local Sage installation will also contain a notebook server with the right kernel.
  * CoCalc: the native format on CoCalc, `*.sagews`.  Make a (free) account and upload, or pay for an account and just clone this repository with the provided internet access.

There is a bash script, which you can experiment with.  However we are distributing, and updating, all the same outputs via this repository.

See [the overview](worksheets/overview.html) for brief descriptions of each worksheet.  If you plan to present these in class, you might practice the exercises in advance.  They are not hard, but better to be prepared than to stumble around in class.
